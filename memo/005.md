# INTRODUCTION AND BACKGROUND  
In  the  weeks  after  adoption  of  the  CSFRA  on  November  8,  2016,  staff  implemented  an  ambitious  outreach  plan  consisting  of  landlord  and  tenant  informational  postcards; community  workshops;   webpage  updates  www.mountainview.gov/rent  stabilization, social  media  and  MyMV  emails;   posting  of  FAQs  and  PPT  Presentations  and  a  Rental  Housing hotline (email, phone, walk-in).Since the court issued the order denying the preliminary injunction on April 5, 2017 and the  CSFRA  became effective,  staff  has  sent  out  letters  to  all  multi-family  apartment  owners/managers   and   tenants   to   provide   an   update   on   their   CSFRA rights   and   obligations. The  website  was  updated  with  key  elements  of  the  CSFRA;  and a   template letter   was   posted   on   the   website   to   help   landlords   and   tenants   understand   and communicate the requirements of the roll back provisions of the CSFRA. Workshops have been planned for May to provide landlord and tenant education.


# ANALYSIS:  
Community Outreach will be essential for the success of the CSFRA program. The goal of community  outreach  is  to  disseminate  information  and  increase  awareness  to  landlords and  tenants,  augmenting  their  knowledge  and  skills,  resulting  in  increased compliance with the CSFRA.  Outreach can consist of a wide range of activities:

1.Increase awareness through distribution of information: develop collateral materials and distribution plan and outreach through internet and social media. Partnering with other organizations such as local churches and organizations (e.g. CSA, Work Center, Clinics, CHAC, Schools, Police, Senior Center, CAA) will increase outreach efforts.Brochures at  Library,  Police,  City  Hall,  Community  Center,  CSA,  Senior  Center,  Work Center, CHAC, CAA, schools, local churches and coffee shops Messages for social media (Nextdoor Neighbor; CNC)Updates website: mountainview.gov/rentstabilizationMailings: landlords/tenants CSFRA in effect, rent increase announcement.2.Community   participation   in   educational   and   public   input   meetings:    organize ongoing  workshops,  walk-in  clinics  and  consultations  in  centers  where  residents  already   gather   for   other   activities   (city   hall,   CSA,   senior   center,   school   PTAs,   community center), and a Rental Housing helpline (phone, email and walk-in).Scheduled workshops:May 15, 2017 & May 25, 2017 6-8 pmTenant WorkshopsMay 16, 2017 10-12 noon & May 22, 2017 6-8 pmLandlord WorkshopsWalk-in Clinics:Once a week (Thursdays) City Hall Once a week CSA/Community CenterOnce a month (4th Tuesday of month) MV Senior centerConsultations:Mo-Fr 9am-4pm at Project Sentinel (email, phone, walk-in)3.Resources:  Provide  online  availability  of  template  notices/letters  for  use  by  tenants  and  landlords  as  well  as  an  online  property  information  tool for  research into  “year  built”  of  multi-family  apartments.  Create  a  list  of  organizations providing  legal resources.Templates: Base Rent letterOnline  tool:  Address  look-up  to  determine  if  rental  unit  is  subject  to  the  CSFRALegal Help: List of organizations on website

4.Language remains a barrier to effective communication. Providing outreach materialsin Spanish and Mandarin is a priority. Outreach meetings can be staffed with Spanish and Mandarin translators. Materials can be translated into these languages.To  date  letters,  flyers  and  templates  have  been  translated  in  Spanish  and Mandarin.Translators will be present at scheduled workshops.Case Manager for clinics and consultation speaks Spanish.


# STAFF RECOMMENDATION:  
Approve the ongoing Community Outreach activities and/or provide further direction to staff to implement additional/different outreach efforts.
