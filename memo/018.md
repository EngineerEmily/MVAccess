# RECOMMENDATION  
Adopt a Resolution Establishing Regulations for a "Vega Adjustment" to be included in the Fair Return Standard of the Regulations (Chapter 6).  

# INTRODUCTION  
The purpose of the CSFRA is to stabilize rents in Mountain View by making rent increases that might otherwise be imposed on resident renters more predictable, while ensuring landlords receive a fair and reasonable return on their investments. During its July 24 meeting, the Rental Housing Committee adopted three chapters of regulations to implement sections 1710 and 1711 of the CSFRA defining the petition and hearing process for landlord and tenant petitions for upward and downward adjustments of rent. In the motionto adoptthe regulations, the RHC directed staff to draft a "generous" Vega Adjustment regulation, with at least two methodologies as described below.  

# BACKGROUND  
The RHC has adopted a fair return standard that ensures landlords may earn a fair rate of  return  on  their  investment,  as  required  by  the  U.S.  and  California  Constitutions, using the maintenance of net operating income ("MNOI") methodology. The purpose of the MNOI methodology is to "maintain" the value of the net operating income received by the landlord prior to stabilization of rents.  

The first step of the MNOI methodology identifies the net operating income a landlord received in the Base Year (i.e.2015 gross income from the property, less 2015 operating expenses).  The second  step adjusts  the  2015  net  operating  income  based  on  an  index (the CPI –Rent of Primary Residence), in order to "maintain" the value of the base year net operating income.If in the Petition Year the landlord is not earning at least the 2015 net  operating  income  as  adjusted  by  the  CPI –Rent  of  Primary  Residence  from  the property, then the landlord would be entitled to a rent increase beyond that allowed by annual general adjustments and vacancy decontrol.  

The "Vega Adjustment" addresses situations where the base year net operating income is  unusually  low  because  the  gross  income  from  the  property  was  unreasonably  low (e.g.  the  rent  charged  for  one  or  more  Rent  Stabilized  Units  in  2015  was unreasonably low).Notably,  Vega  Adjustments  are  one-way:  they  allow  increases  in  rent  to  address unreasonably low Base Year Gross Income but do not allow downward adjustments for high Base Year Gross Income.In a 1990 court case, Vega v. City of West Hollywood, West Hollywood  was  required  to  revise  the  base  year  gross  income for  a  landlord when implementing rent stabilization using the MNOI methodology.1 West Hollywood's rent stabilization ordinance allowed for base year gross income to be adjusted if that income was "disproportionately low" due to "peculiar circumstances." West Hollywood had not defined what income qualified as "disproportionately low," which lead to a complicated hearing   process   and   ultimately,   litigation.Therefore,   staff   recommends   defining "unreasonably low" rents to determine Vega Adjustments.  

The  RHC  identified  two  potential  methods  to  define  and  quantify  "unreasonably  low" Base  Year  Gross  Income  in  accordance  with  the Vega case  to  provide  a  clear  rule  for landlords, tenants, and Hearing Officers. One method to define unreasonably low Base Year Gross Income would be based on standardized rent amounts published by the U.S. Department  of  Housing  and  Urban  Development  ("HUD").  Another  method  would require  statistical  analysis,  comparing  the  rent  for  any  unit  for  which  a  landlord allegedly  received  unreasonably  low  rent  in  the  Base  Year  with  the  average  rent charged  by  the  same  landlord  in  the  base  year  for  other  Rent  Stabilized  Units  in Mountain View. Options incorporating each methodology are analyzed below.  

# ANALYSIS  
In  response  to  the  direction  from  the  RHC,  Staff  has  prepared  threeoptions  of draft regulations to define and quantify unreasonably low Base Year Gross Income based on data  published  by  HUD  and  based  on  a  statistical  analysis  of  the  petitioner-landlord's Base  Year  rents.  In  addition  to  the  three  proposed  regulation  methodologies,  there  are two questions that will inform any proposal. First, which HUD data should be usedin each  of  the  draft  regulations?After  selecting  the  data  set  and  methodology,  there  is  a question about the proper allocation of any rent increases based on a Vega Adjustment.  

**HUD County-Level and ZIPCode-Level Fair Market Rents (FMRs)**  
HUD annually estimates fair market rents (FMRs) for 530 metropolitan areas and 2,045 nonmetropolitan  county  FMR  areas.  Standard  FMR  data  is  published  at  the  County level (e.g. the draft regulations could use data published for all of Santa Clara County). HUD  recently  began  publishing  more  localized  FMRs  by ZIPcode,  including  data covering Mountain View.  

County-level FMRs are primarily used to determine payment standard amounts for the Housing Choice Voucher program, to determine initial renewal rents forsome expiring project-based  Section  8  contracts,  to  determine  initial  rents  for  housing  assistance payment  contracts  in  the  Moderate  Rehabilitation  Single  Room  Occupancy  program, and  to  serve  as  a  rent  ceiling  in  the  HOME  rental  assistance  program.   ZIPcode-level FMRs  are  a  pilot  project  and  are  officially permitted  to  be  used  only  to  set  Section  8 Housing  Choice  Voucher  payment  standards  in  the  Dallas,  Texas  HUD  Metropolitan FMR  Area  and  by  public  housing  authorities participating  in  the  SmallArea  FMR Demonstration Program.Adequate Santa Clara County-level and ZIPcode-level data is available for the Base Year of 2015 to use either data set. The HUD county-level and ZIPcode-level FMRs for the 2015 Base Year are listed below.  

| . | Efficiency | 1-Bedroom | 2-Bedroom | 3-Bedroom | 4-Bedroom |  
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |  
Santa Clara County | $1,213 | $1,419 | $1,809 | $2,325 | $2,636 |  
| 94035 | $1,210 | $1,420 | $1,810 | $2,550 | $3,120 |  
| 94040 | $1,210| $1,410 | $1,800 | $2,540 | $3,100 |  
| 94041 | $1,270 | $1,480 | $1,890 | $2,670 | $3,250 |  
| 94042 | $1,210 | $1,420 | $1,810 | $2,550 | $3,120 |  
| 94043 | $1,250 | $1,460 | $1,860 | $2,620 | $3,200 |  

**Option A: HUD Fair Market Rents—Per Unit Adjustment**  
Option A, the FMR—Per Unit Adjustment, is the simplest method to quantify unreasonably low unit rents in the Base Year. Upon submitting a petition for upward adjustment of rents, if a landlord received less than the identified FMR rent per month during the Base Year for a Rent Stabilized Unit in the subject property, then that landlord's Base Year Gross Income would be increased to equal what the landlord would  have  hypothetically  earned  if  the  landlord  had  received  the  FMR  rent  for  that unit. An example of the FMR—Per Unit Adjustment methodology is provided below.  

*EXAMPLE 1: County-Level FMR—Per Unit Adjustment*  
| Unit | Unit Type | Rent/Month | Annual Rent/Unit | Base Year Gross Income |  
| 1 | Efficiency | $1,150 | $13,800 | $108,000 |  
| 2 | Efficiency | $1,250 | $15,000 | $108,000 |  
|3 | 1-Bedroom | $1,500 | $18,000 | $108,000 |  
| 4 | 1-Bedroom | $1,550 | $18,600 | $108,000 |  
| 5 | 2-Bedroom | $1,750 | $21,000 | $108,000 |  
| 6 | 2-Bedroom | $1,800 | $21,600 | $108,000 |  

County-Level FMR—Per Unit Adjustment(Applied to Unit 1)

| Unit | Unit Type | Rent/Month | Annual Rent/Unit | Vega Adjusted Base Year Gross Income |  
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |   
| 1 | Efficiency | $1,213 | $14,556 | $108,756 |  

**Option B:HUD Fair Market Rents—Per Property Adjustment**  
Option B, the FMR—Per Property Adjustment, is slightly more complicated than Option A, the FMR—Per Unit Adjustment, but better accommodates the MNOI methodology by quantifying unreasonably low Base Year unit rents in the context of the property. Upon submitting a petition for upward adjustment of rents, the landlord's Base Year Gross Income would be compared to the hypothetical Base Year Gross Income that the  Landlord would have received if the landlord had charged FMR rents for all units in the property. If the landlord's Base Year Gross Income were less than the hypothetical Gross Income using the FMRs, then the landlord's petition for upward adjustment of rents would use the hypothetical Gross Income for purposes of the MNOI methodology. Example 2 shows the FMR—Per Property Adjustment methodology.  

*EXAMPLE 2: County-Level FMR—Per PropertyAdjustment*  
| Unit | Unit Type | Rent/Month | Annual Rent/Unit | Base Year Gross Income |  
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |  
| 1 | Efficiency | $1,150 | $13,800 | $108,000 |  
| 2 | Efficiency | $1,250 | $15,000 | $108,000 |  
| 3 | 1-Bedroom | $1,500 | $18,000 | $108,000 |  
| 4 | 1-Bedroom | $1,550 | $18,600 | $108,000 |  
| 5 | 2-Bedroom | $1,750 | $21,000 | $108,000 |  
| 6 | 2-Bedroom | $1,800 | $21,600 | $108,000 |  

County-Level FMR—Per Property Adjustment

| 2 | Efficiency | $1,213 | $14,556 | . |  
| 3 | 1-Bedroom | $1,419 | $17,028 | . |  
| 4 | 1-Bedroom | $1,419 | $17,028 | . |  
| 5 | 2-Bedroom | $1,809 | $21,708 | . |  
| 6 | 2-Bedroom | $1,809 | $20,708 | . |  

Base Year Gross Income > Vega Adjustment, so no Vega Adjustment warranted  

Example  2  uses  the  same  unit  count,  unit  mix,  and  rents  as  Example  1.    However,  in Example  2  Base  Year  Gross  Income ($108,000) is  greater  than  the  Vega  Adjusted  Base Year  Gross  Income ($106,584) and  so  the  landlord  would  not  be  entitled  to  a  Vega Adjustment for that property.In this example, if the Base Year Gross Income were less than $106,584, then the landlord would be entitled to a Vega Adjustment.  

The   FMR—Per   Property   Adjustment   better   fulfills   the   purposes   of   the   MNOI methodology by looking holistically at a landlord's gross income from the property. The FMR—Per   Property   Adjustment is   more   consistent   with   the   MNOI   fair   return methodology  than the  FMR—Per  Unit  Adjustment,  which  adjusts  only  for  individual units  with  unreasonably  low  rents  without  accounting  for  other  unit  rents  from  the property that may cross-subsidize or otherwise justify the unreasonably low rent from a particular unit.  

Option C: Two Standard Deviations from Mean Rents Received by LandlordOption C, initially outlined by RHC Member Means, would quantify unreasonably low rent  on  a  per-unit  basisin  the  Base  Year.  Upon  submitting  a  petition  for  upward adjustment  of  rents,  a  Hearing  Officer  would  compare  the  difference  between  the monthly rent for each unit with the average rent charged by the landlord for all units in the same property.  If the monthly rent for any unit was less than the average monthly rent  chargedfor  all  units  in  the  buildingby  the  landlord  by  two  standard  deviations, then the landlord would be entitled to a Vega Adjustment for the property.  

A  standard  deviation  is  a  statistical quantification  of  variations  among  a set  of numbers.  Figure  1  visualizes what   is   referred   to   as   a   "normal distribution." The percentages in and above the figure show where most of the  data  points  would  be  graphed (e.g.  most  data  points  are  clustered near  the  center  line  or  mean).  The numbers  and  symbol  (σ  or  sigma) below    the    figure    identifies    the standard  deviation  associated  with  each  statistical  area  in  a  normal  distribution  (e.g.  a standard  deviation  measures  the  statistical  distance  between  one  data  point  and  the average  value  of  the  complete  data  set).Zero  sigma  (0)  is  the  center  line,  or  the statistical  mean.  34.1%  of  the  data  points  in  a  normal  distribution  will  be  between  the mean and positive one sigma (1σ); 64.2% of all data points in a normal distribution will be  plus  or  minus  one  standarddeviation  from  the  mean  (+/-1σ, the dark blue area in Figure  1).    Similarly,  95.6%  of  all  data  points  will  be  plus  or  minus  two  standard deviations from the mean (+/-2σ).  

FIGURE 1:  Normal Distribution2 
[insert image]  

For  use  in  the  Vega  Adjustment  setting,  the  average,  mean  rent  would  be  zero  on the normal distribution figure. Any unit with an average monthly rent in the Base Year that was  less  than  negative  two  sigma  (-2σ)  would  be  considered  unreasonably  low  and therefore qualify for a Vega Adjustment.  

Example 3, below,demonstrates how the standard deviation methodology would work using the same rents as Examples 1 and 2. Like Example 2, the two standard deviation methodology does not result in a Vega Adjustment in Example 3.  

EXAMPLE 3: Two Standard Deviations from Mean Rents Adjustment  
| Unit | Unit Type | Rent/Month($) | Annual Rent/Unit($) | Difference Unit Rent less Mean Rent ($) | Qualifies for Vega Adjustment? |  
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |  
| 1 | Efficiency | 1,150 | 13,800 | -350 | . |  
| 2 | Efficiency | 1,250 | 15,000 | -250 | . |  
| 3 | 1-Bedroom | 1,500 | 18,000 | 0 | No |  
| 4 | 1-Bedroom | 1,550 | 18,600 | 50 | . |  
| 5 | 2-Bedroom | 1,750 | 21,000 | 250 | . |  
| 6 | 2-Bedroom | 1,800 | 21,600 | 300 | . |  

Sum: 108,000  
Mean Monthly Rent(Sum / Unit Count) / 12 Months: 1,500  
Standard Deviation: 238.05  
Two Standard Deviations: 476.10  

Mathematically  the  two  standard  deviation  methodology  would  never  allow  a  Vega Adjustment  for  properties  with  five  or  fewer  units  because  any  rents  charged  for  the five units will always fall within two standard deviations of the mean rent, even if one of the  five  units  paid  only  one  dollar  per  month.  Accordingly,  staff  recommends  that the  two  standard  deviation  methodology  use  the  HUD  FMRs  to  augment  the  rents  of four and five unit properties.  

Example 4, on the following page, demonstrates how the HUD FMRs would be used to augment rents for a four-unit property, as drafted in Option C of the regulations.  

EXAMPLE 4: Two Standard Deviations from Mean Rents Adjustmentwith HUD FMRs  
| Unit | Unit Type | Rent/Month($) | Annual Rent/Unit($) | Difference Unit Rent less Mean Rent ($) | Qualifies for Vega Adjustment? |

| 2 | 1-Bedroom | 1,600 | 19,200 | 177 | . |  
| 3 | 1-Bedroom | 1,600 | 19,200 | 177 | Yes |  
| 4 | 1-Bedroom | 1,600 | 19,200 | 177 | . |  
| FMR | 1-Bedroom | 1,419 | 17,028 | . | . |  
| FMR | 1-Bedroom | 1,419 | 17,028 | . | . |  

Sum: 102,456  
Mean Monthly Rent(Sum / Unit Count) / 12 Months: 1,423  
Standard Deviation: 247.50  
Two Standard Deviations: 495 

Because  of  the  complexity  of  the  standard  deviation  methodology  and  as  it  requires augmentation  for  four  and five  unit  properties,  staff  recommends  using  another methodology.  

**Allocation of Rent Increases Based on the Vega Adjustment**  
It is important to note that the Vega Adjustment standard is one component of the fair return  standard  and  any  upward  increase  in  rent  in  excess  of  the  annual  general adjustment  under  the  CSFRA  requires  a  landlord  petition.  However,  properties  with units  for  which  unreasonably  low  rents  were  charged  in  2015,  and  that  have  not experienced vacancy decontrol,will be more likely to receive a rent increase under the MNOI fair return methodology.  

The  RHC  must  determine  whether  the  portion  of  the  rent  increase  attributed  to  the Vega  Adjustment  should  be  allocated  only  to  those  units  that  triggered  the  Vega Adjustment,  or  should  be  equally allocated  to  all  units  in  the  building.  Either  of  these variants  (allocating  Vega  Adjustment-based  rent  increases  per  unit  or  equally  to  all units) can be accommodated in any of the options (FMR-Per Unit Adjustment, FMR-Per Property Adjustment, or Two Standard Deviations from Mean Rents).  

# FISCAL IMPACT  
The adopted regulations will be used to determine the time and consequently the costs the Hearing Officers spend on each petition, and therefore, the budget of the RHC.

Standard Deviation Formula

Notes: 
[insert image]  

For purposes of the Vega Adjustment, the standard deviation is calculated by first calculating the  average rent for  all units  in  the  building  (mean  rent).    Second,  each  unit  rent  is  compared  to  the  mean  rent.  Third,  the difference  between  the  unit  rent  and  mean  rent  is  squared.    Fourth,  the  squared  differences  for  all  rents  are added together.  Fifth, the sum of the squared differences is divided by the number of units; the square  root of that number is the standard deviation. The formula for calculating the standard deviation is provided above and interpreted below.

### G.Base Year Rebuttable Presumption
1. [Previously Adopted.]  It is presumed that the Net Operating Income produced by a property during the Base Year provided a fair return on investment for the property.  Landlords shall be entitled to maintain their Net Operating Income from year to year in accordance with this Chapter 6.  

2. [Previously adopted.]  The Landlord, in a Petition for Upward Adjustment of Rents, may rebut the presumption that the Net Operating Income produced by a property during the Base Year provided a fair return on investment for the property by demonstrating peculiar circumstances unique to the property that caused either the Gross Income or Operating Expenses during the Base Year to differ significantly from either the Gross Income or Operating Expenses of other properties of similar size, quality, andconditions.  

3. Vega Adjustment Standard.  
  a. __Defining Unreasonably Low Average Monthly Rent.__ The Landlord, in a Petition for Upward Adjustment of Rents, will be presumed to have rebutted the presumption that the Net Operating Income produced by a property during the Base Year provided a fair return on investment for the property if the average monthly Rent received in the Base Year for an individual Rent Stabilized Unit in the property was unusually low.  For purposes of this section, unusually low means that the average monthly Rent received for the occupancy and use of the Rent Stabilized Unit was less than [OPTIONA(i)or A(ii): choose either (i) county FMRs or (ii) zip code FMRs.]

  b. __Calculating the Average Monthly Rent Received in the Base Year for an Individual Rent Stabilized Unit.__ To calculate the average monthly Rent received in the Base Year, divide the sum of all Rent received that relates to one Rent Stabilized Unit by the number of months for which Rent was received for that unit, regardless of the number of tenants occupying, or the number of tenancies for, that Rent Stabilized Unit in the Base Year (e.g. if Unit X was occupied from January 2015 through June 2015 for $1,000 per month, was vacant in July 2015, and was occupied from August 2015 through December 2015 for $1,110 per month, then the average monthly Rent received in the Base Year for Unit X would be $11,550 divided by 11 months of occupancy, or $1,050 per month of occupancy).  
  c. __Recalculating Base Year Gross Income.__ If the average monthly Rent received for any individual Rent Stabilized Unit in the property during the Base Year was less than the fair market rents defined in subsection (a) of this Section G(3) above, then the Base Year Gross Income for the property shall be recalculated for purposes of determining the Base Year Net Operating Income by (1) subtracting the actual Rent received from each Rent Stabilized Unit for which the average monthly Rent received was unusually low, and (2) adding the fair market rent for the most similar unit type, for the same dates of occupancy and, in the same geographic area, as described above.  
  d. __Contesting Recalculation of Base Year Gross Income.__ One or more Tenants may contest or dispute any recalculation of the Base Year Gross Income for purposes of determining the Base Year Net Operating Income in a Landlord's Petition for Upward Adjustment of Rents.  Tenant arguments contesting or disputingany recalculation of the Base Year Gross Income may include, but are not limited to, evidence or documentation related to the physical condition of the property or any individual Rent Stabilized Unit, the market conditions that relate to the property or any individual Rent Stabilized Unit, and/or any other relevant evidence that a recalculation of the Base Year Gross Income, as contemplated in this Section G, is unnecessary for the landlord to receive a fair return on investment for the property, fails to ensure fairness, or is otherwise contrary to the purposes of the Act.  
  e. __Allocation of Upward Adjustment of Rents.__ The portion of any Upward Adjustment of Rents that results solely from the Vega Adjustment described in this Section G(3) shall be allocated: **[Option A choose either(i) or (ii)]**  
    i. equally among each Rent Stabilized Unit for which average monthly Rents were unreasonably low, **or**  
	ii. equally among all Rent Stabilized Units subject to the Petition, subject to the condition that in the interest of justice, a Hearing Officer and/or the Rental Housing Committee may allocate Rent increases in another manner necessary to ensure fairness and further the purposes of the Act.

The Base Year Gross Income shall be replaced with the total Rent that would have been received if the Rent for each Rent Stabilized Unit in the property were equal to the fair market rent for the most similar unit type, in the same geographic area, and based on the same occupancy status, as described above (e.g. if a Landlord received Rent for four one-bedroom units in Building X for 12 months of occupancy each, and received Rent for 11 months of occupancy for a fifth one-bedroom unit in Building X, then the total recalculated Base Year Gross Income would equal the fair market rent for a one-bedroom unit multiplied by four units, multiplied by 12 months, plus the fair market rent for a one-bedroom unit, multiplied by one unit, multiplied by 11 months, or 59 total months of occupancy of one-bedroom units at fair market rent).  
  c. __Contesting Recalculation of Base Year Gross Income.__ One or more Tenants may contest or dispute any recalculation of the Base Year Gross Income for purposes of determining the Base Year Net Operating Income in a Landlord's Petition for Upward Adjustment of Rents.  Tenant arguments contesting or disputing any recalculation of the Base Year Gross Income may include, but are not limited, evidence or documentation related to the physical condition of the property or any individual Rent Stabilized Unit, the market conditions that relate to the property or any individual Rent Stabilized Unit, and/or any other relevant evidence that a recalculation of the Base Year Gross Income, as contemplated in this Section G, is unnecessary for the landlord to receive a fair return on investment for the property, fails to ensure fairness, or is otherwise contrary to the purposes of the Act.

### G.Base Year Rebuttable Presumption
1. [Previously Adopted.]  It is presumed that the Net Operating Income produced by a property during the Base Year provided a fair return on investment for the property.  Landlords shall be entitled to maintain their Net Operating Income from year to year in accordance with this Chapter 6.  

2. [Previously adopted.]  The Landlord, in a Petition for Upward Adjustment of Rents, may rebut the presumption that the Net Operating Income produced by a property during the Base Year provided a fair return on investment for the property by demonstrating peculiar circumstances unique to the property that caused either the Gross Income or Operating Expenses during the Base Year to differ significantly from either the Gross Income or Operating Expenses of other properties of similar size, quality, andconditions.  

3. Vega Adjustment Standard.  
  a. __Defining Unreasonably Low Average Monthly Rent.__ The Landlord, in a Petition for Upward Adjustment of Rents, will be presumed to have rebutted the presumption that the Net Operating Income produced by a property during the Base Year provided a fair return on investment for the property if the average monthly Rent received for any individual Rent Stabilized Unit in the property during the Base Year was unusually low.  For purposes of this section, unusually low means that the average monthly Rent received for the Rent Stabilized Unit was less than the mean monthly Rent received for all of the Rent Stabilized Units in the property by two standard deviations.  
  b. __Calculating the Average Monthly Rent Received in the Base Year for an Individual Rent Stabilized Unit.__ To calculate the average monthly Rent received in the Base Year, divide the sum of all Rent received that relates to one Rent Stabilized Unit by the number of months for which Rent was received for that Rent Stabilized Unit, regardless of the number of tenants occupying or the number of tenancies in the Base Year (e.g. if Unit X was occupied from January 2015 through June 2015 for $1,000 per month, was vacant in July 2015, and was occupied from August 2015 through December 2015 for $1,110 per month, then the average monthly Rent received in the Base Year for Unit X would be $11,550 divided by 11 months of occupancy, or $1,050 per month of occupancy).  
  c. __Calculating the Standard Deviation and Mean Monthly Rent Received for All Rent Stabilized Units for Properties with Five or Fewer Rent Stabilized Units.__  
    i. __Mean Monthly Rent.__ To calculate the mean monthly Rent, complete the following steps:  
      (1) Add each average monthly Rent for every Rent Stabilized Unit in the property, as calculated in accordance with subsection (b) of Section G(3) above,  
	  (2) Add one"fair market rent" (as published by the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development for fiscal year 2015 for Santa Clara County, as replicated in the table below), for the most prevalent Rent Stabilized Unit type in the property based on the number of bedrooms, until the hypothetical total number of units equals six (e.g. in step two, a property with four Rent Stabilized, one-bedroom units would add two fair market rents [2 x $1,419], or $2,838 to the sum in step one).  
	  | Efficiency | 1-Bedroom | 2-Bedroom | 3-Bedroom | 4-Bedroom |  
	  | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |  
	  | $1,213 | $1,419 | $1,809 | $2,551 | $2,892 |  
	  (3) The mean monthly Rent is the result when the sum of steps one and two above are divided by six (6).  
    ii. __Standard Deviation from Mean Monthly Rent.__ To calculate the standard deviation from mean monthly rent for properties with five or fewer Rent Stabilized Units, complete the following steps:  
	  (1) For each average monthly rent for every Rent Stabilized Unit and for each fair market rent added in subsection (c)(i)(2) of Section G(3), subtract the Mean Monthly Rent, and then square the result.  
	  (2) Add all of the values calculated in step 1.  
	  (3) Divide the sum calculated in step 2 by six (6).  
	  (4) The standard deviation from the mean monthly Rent equals the square root of the result from step 3.  
  d. __Calculating the Standard Deviation from the Mean Monthly Rent Received for All Rent Stabilized Units for Properties with Six or More Rent Stabilized Units.__  
    i. __Mean Monthly Rent.__ To calculate the mean monthly Rent, addeach average monthly Rent for every Rent Stabilized Unit in the property, as calculated in accordance with subsection (b) of Section G(3) above, and then divide the sum by the total number of Rent Stabilized Units.  
	ii. __Standard Deviation from Mean Monthly Rent.__ To calculate the standard deviation from mean monthly rent for properties with six or more Rent Stabilized Units, complete the following steps:  
	  (1) For each average monthly rent for every Rent Stabilized Unit, subtract the Mean Monthly Rent, and then square the result.  
	  (2) Add all of the values calculated in step 1.  
	  (3) Divide the sum calculated in step 2 by the total number of Rent Stabilized Units.  
	  (4) The standard deviation from the mean monthly Rent equals the square root of the result from step 3.  
  e. __Recalculating Base Year Gross Income.__ If the average monthly Rent received for any individual Rent Stabilized Unit in the property during the Base Year was less than the mean monthly Rent by two standard deviations from the mean monthly rent, then the Base Year Gross Income for the property shall be recalculated for purposes of determining the Base Year Net Operating Income by: (1) subtracting all Rent received from each Rent Stabilized Unit for which the average monthly Rent received was unusually low, and (2) replacing the subtracted Rent on a month-by-month basis, per Rent Stabilized Unit, with the mean monthly Rent, less two standard deviations from the mean monthly rent.  
  f. __Contesting Recalculation of Base Year Gross Income.__ One or more Tenants may contest or dispute any recalculation of the Base Year Gross Income for purposes of determining the Base Year Net Operating Income in a Landlord's Petition for Upward Adjustment of Rents.  Tenant arguments contesting or disputing any recalculation of the Base Year Gross Income may include, but are not limited, evidence or documentation related to the physical condition of the property or any individual Rent Stabilized Unit, the market conditions that relate to the property or any individual Rent Stabilized Unit, and/or any other relevant evidence that a recalculation of the Base Year Gross Income, as contemplated in this Section G, is unnecessary for the landlord to receive a fair return on investment for the property, fails to ensure fairness, or is otherwise contrary to the purposes of the Act.  
  g. __Allocation of Upward Adjustment of Rents.__ The portion of any Upward Adjustment of Rents that results solely from the Vega Adjustment described in this Section G(3) shall be allocated:[OptionC choose either(i) or (ii)]  
    i. equally among each Rent Stabilized Unit for which average monthly Rents were unreasonably low, **or**  
	ii. equally among all Rent Stabilized Unit subjectto the Petition,subject to the condition that in the interest of justice, a Hearing Officer and/or the RentalHousing Committee may allocate Rent increases in another manner necessary to ensure fairness and further the purposes of the Act.
