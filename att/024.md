## HUD Fair Market Rents Information <sup>[1](#footer)</sup>

The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) annually estimates Fair Market Rents (FMRs)for 530 metropolitan areas and 2,045 nonmetropolitan county FMR areas. FMRs are primarily used to determine payment standard amounts for the Housing Choice Voucher program, to determine initial renewal rents for some expiring project-based Section 8 contracts, to determine initial rents for housing assistance payment contracts in the Moderate Rehabilitation Single Room Occupancy program, and to serve as a rent ceiling in the HOME rental assistance program.  

## HUD Small Area Fair Market Rents Information <sup>[2](#footer)</sup>  

Due to the increasing demand for more localized rents for a variety of purposes, HUD is making Small Area FMRs for all metropolitan areas available. Although data is available nationwide, Small Area FMRs are only permitted to be used to set Section 8 Housing Choice Voucher payment standards in the Dallas, TX HUD Metropolitan FMR Area and by PHAs participating in the Small Area FMR Demonstration Program.
