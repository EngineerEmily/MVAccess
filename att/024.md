A.Statement of Purpose1.Authority.Section 1700 of the Community Stabilization and Fair Rent Act(“Act”) states that one purpose of the voter-approved initiative is to control “excessive rent increases  and  arbitrary  evictions  to  the  greatest  extent  allowable  under California law, while ensuring Landlords a fair and reasonable return on their investment.”Subsections   (d)(1),   (d)(2),   and   (e)   of   Section   1709,   and subsection  (a)  of  Section  1710  of  theActprovide  that  the  Rental  Housing Committee  has  the  authority  to  adopt  and  shall  establish  regulations  to further the purposes of the Act.2.Constraints.Subsection  (a)  of  Section  1710  of  the Actauthorizes  petitions  for  upward adjustments  of  rents  necessary  to  provide  a  Landlord  with  a  fair  rate  of return.    Subsections  (a)(2)  and  (a)(3)  define  relevant  factors  that  must  be included  and  excluded  from  consideration  when  ensuring  a  fair  rate  of return. Among  other  factors  to  be  considered  when  ensuring  a  fair  rate  of return, subsections (a)(2) and (a)(3) of Section 1710 require inclusion of capital improvements “necessary  to  bring  the  Property  into  compliance  or  maintain compliance  with  applicable  localcodes  affecting  health  and  safety,”and exclude the costs of “capital improvements that are not necessary to bring the Property into compliance or maintain compliance with applicable local codes affecting health and safety”and further exclude the costs of “ordinary repair, replacement,  and  maintenance.”Subsection  (a)(3)  of  Section  1710  excludes from  consideration  when  ensuring  a  fair  rate  of  return  the “costs  of  debt servicing  (includingbut  not  limited  to  principal,  interest,  and  fees)  for  any debt  obtained  after  October  19,  2015”other  than  debt  for  qualifying  capital improvements.3.Purpose.The  purpose  of  this  Chapter  6  is  to  implement  the  purposes  of  the Actby detailing  the  method  of  ensuring  Landlords  may  earn  a  fair  and  reasonable rate  of  return  on  their  investment,  which  shall  be  achieved  through  the maintenance of a Landlord’s net operating income as defined in this Chapter.  Nothing in these regulations shall be interpreted to prohibit a Hearing Officer or   the   Rental   Housing   Commission   from granting   an   individual   Rent Adjustment that is demonstrated by the Landlord to be necessary to provide the Landlord with a fair rate of return.  

B.Fair Return StandardA Landlord’s fair rate of return on investment for a property containing a Covered Rental  Unit  for  the  Petition  Year  is  the “Adjusted Net  Operating  Income.”For purposes  of  this  Section  (B),  the  Adjusted  Net  Operating  Income  shall  equal  the Net  Operating  Income for  the  Base  Year, adjustedbythe  percentage  increase  or decrease in the Consumer Price Index between the Base Year and the Petition Year.If the Landlord’s actual Net Operating Income for a property in the Petition Year is less  than  the  Adjusted  Net  Operating  Income,  then  the  Landlord  shall  be  entitled to  an  Upward  Adjustment  of  Rents  for  that  property  sufficient  to  provide  a  Net Operating Income equal to theAdjusted Net Operating Income.  

C.DefinitionsFor  purposes  of  Chapter  6, the  following  definitions  apply;  all  other  capitalized terms are defined by the Act:1.Base Year.  The Base Year is calendar year[Alternative:2014 / 2015].2.Capital   Improvement.

The  Petition  Year  shall  be  defined  as  the  calendar  year  for which the most recent Consumer Price Index data was published for the San Francisco-Oakland-San Jose area prior to acceptance of a Petition for Upward Adjustment  of  rent.    If  actual  data  for  the  complete  Petition  Year  is  not available,  Net  Operating  Income  shall  be  estimated  in  accordance  with calculations defined in subsection (C)(2) of Chapter 6.  

D.Calculation of Gross IncomeGross Income shall equal the total of the following:1.Gross Rents   lawfully   collectible   from   each   Rental   Unit   located   on   the property,  calculated  on  the  basis  of  one  hundred  percent  (100%)  rental occupancy for twelve (12) months; and2.The imputed rental value of any owner-occupied Rental Unit or Rental Units; and3.Income  from  coin-operated  laundry  facilities,  vending  machines,and  similar income  (but  excluding  rents  and  other  income  from  any  commercial  space located on the property, if applicable); and4.Interest   from   security,   cleaning,   and   any   other   deposits   received   from Tenants (except to the extent paid to Tenants); and5.All  other  income  or  consideration  received  or  receivable  in  connection  with the use or occupancy of the Rental Units and Housing Services;and6.Less  uncollected Rents  due  to  vacancy  and  uncollectable  debts,  to  the  extent that  the  same  are  beyond  theLandlord’s  good-faith  efforts  to  ensure  each Rental  Unit  is  occupied  and  debts  are  paid.    Any  uncollected Rents  due  to vacancy  are  to  be  calculated  at  the Rent  for  the  most  recent  tenancy.    Any uncollected Rents  in  excess  of  three  percent  (3%)  of  Gross Income  are presumed to be unreasonable unless established otherwise.

G.Base Year Rebuttable Presumption1.It is presumed that the Net Operating Income produced by a property during the   Base   Year   provided   a   fair   return   on   investment   for   the   property.  Landlords shall be entitled to maintain their Net Operating Income from year to year in accordance with this Chapter 6.2.The  Landlord,  in  a  Petition  for  Upward  Adjustment  of Rents,  may  rebut  the presumption  that  the  Net  Operating  Income  produced  by  a  property  during the  Base  Year  provided  a  fair  return  on  investment  for  the  property  by demonstrating  peculiar  circumstances  unique  to  the  property  that  caused either the Gross Income or Operating Expenses during the Base Year to differ significantly  from  either  the  Gross  Income  or  Operating  Expenses  of  other properties of similar size, quality, and conditions.3.[Vega Adjustment Provisions][placeholder—see staff report]  

H.Estimation  of  Base  Year  Operating  Expenses  in  the  Absence  of  Base  YearOperating Expense RecordsIf  records  demonstrating  all  or  a  portion  of  Base  Year  Operating  Expenses  for  a property are unavailable, a Hearing Officer shall use the best information available to  estimate  any  reasonable  Operating  Expenses  for  which  reliable  records  are unavailable.  The best information available may include reliable records from the property  for  another  year,  data  or  rate  information  or  other  sources  of  cost information  may  be  considered  in  estimating  the  level  of  particular  Operating Expenses  in  the  Base  Year.    A  Landlord, Tenant,  the  Rental  Housing  Committee, and/or  a  Hearing  Officer  may  introduce  information  to  estimate  any  reasonable Operating Expenses for which reliable records are unavailable, including increases or decreases in Operating Expenses between the Base Year and the Petition Year.  

I.Retention of Base Year RecordsLandlords are required to keep all financial records for the Base Year that may be necessary  to  confirm  the  Gross  Income,  or  Operating  Expenses,  or  both,  for purposes  of  calculating  the  NetOperating  Income  for  the  property.    Failure  to retain Base Year records confirming Gross Income, or Operating Expenses, or both, for the Base Year shall not, of itself, rebut the presumption that the Net Operating Income  produced  by  a  property  during  the Base  Year  provided  a  fair  return  on investment  for  the  property.    Failure  to  retain  Base  Year  records  may  require estimation to calculate Base Year Net Operating Income as defined in Section E of this Chapter.  

J.Allocation of Upward Adjustment of RentsUpward  Adjustments  of Rents  authorized  by  Hearing  Officers  and/or  the  Rental Housing  Committee  shall  be  allocated  equally  among  all  Rental  Units  in  the property, subject to the condition that in the interests of justice, a  Hearing Officer and/or  the  RentalHousing  Committee  may  allocate Rent  increases  in  another manner necessary to ensure fairnessand further the purposes of the Act.  

K.Partial InvalidityIf  any  provision  of  this  Chapter  6,  or  the  application  thereof  to  any  person  or circumstance,  is  held  invalid,  this  invalidity  shall  not  affect  other  provisions  or applications of this Chapter 6 or these Regulations thatcan be given effect without the  invalid  provision  or  application,  and  to  this  end  the  provisions  of  this Regulation   are   declared   to   be   severable.      The   Regulation   shall   be   liberally construed to achieve the purposes of the Act.
