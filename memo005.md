# BACKGROUND:    
The  CSFRA  Rental  Housing  Committee  is  charged  with  a  number  of  tasks,  including   but   not   limited   to   establishing   rules   and   regulations   for   the   enforcement  of  the  CSFRA,  determining  the  Annual  General  Adjustment  and  announcing  it  by  June  30th  of  each  year,  appointing  hearing  officers  and  establishing a budget and Rental Housing Fee.

# ANALYSIS:  
Staff proposes  an  Initial  Work  Plan  which  outlines  a  list  of  tasks  or  issues  staff will bring forward in the coming months to the Rental Housing Committee for discussion, review,  consideration  and  possible  adoption  in  order  to  implement  the Community Stabilization and Fair Rent Act.

# REQUESTED DIRECTION:  
Staff  seeks  input  from  the  RHC  on  the  work  plan,  both  in  terms  of  the  content  and   the   timeline.   Staff   would   also   emphasize   that the   workload   for   the   Committee  is  significant  and  the  intent  of  the  draft  work plan  is  to  provide  a  blueprint to guide the work of the Committee. It remains to be seen whether the proposed  work  plan  is  accurate  in  terms  of  the  number  of  meetings  or  amount  of time allocated to each work plan item or needs to be adjusted accordingly.
